- ✅ Flexible string systems (N-delimiter quotes, backticks, comments)
- ✅ Maximal munch symbol matching
- ✅ Position tracking for error reporting
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (129 tests)

#### Parser (✅ Core Complete)
- ✅ Pratt parser with full operator precedence
- ✅ Function definitions (multiple styles)
- ✅ Pattern matching functions
- ✅ Array generators and sequence notation
- ✅ Matrix and tensor parsing
