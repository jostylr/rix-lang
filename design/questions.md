# Open Language Design Areas and Checklist

This checklist identifies further topics for your mathematical language specification. Use it as a reference for discussion, decision-making, or as a living document to guide future development.

---

## 1. Error Handling and Exceptions

* [ ] How are errors surfaced (e.g., division by zero, type errors, undefined variables)?
* [ ] Null vs. Error: When does each apply? (Soft fail vs. hard stop)
* [ ] Are there custom error objects or stacks?
* [ ] Can users catch/handle errors? (e.g., `Try { ... } Catch { ... }`)
* [ ] How are warnings delivered?

## 2. Type System and Coercion Rules

* [ ] When and how does implicit vs. explicit type conversion occur?
* [ ] What are the rules for type mixing (e.g., integer + rational, rational + interval, array + set)?
* [ ] What counts as equality? (e.g., `3 == 3.0`, `[1,2] == {1,2}`)
* [ ] Can variables have type annotations? Or is everything inferred?

## 3. Variable Scope and Lifetimes

* [ ] How are variables scoped? (Block, local, global, module?)
* [ ] Can inner blocks shadow outer variables?
* [ ] Are there rules for garbage collection or when values are released?

## 4. Modules, Imports, and Namespaces

* [ ] How is code organized and reused? (E.g., via `Load("foo")`)
* [ ] Are there namespaces or module objects?
* [ ] How are naming conflicts resolved between user/system/module variables?

## 5. Standard Library and Environment

* [ ] What functions and types are always available?
* [ ] How is the help system invoked or extended?
* [ ] Can system/module functions be extended or overridden?

## 6. Input/Output and Interactivity

* [ ] How is user input read? (Prompt, file, stream)
* [ ] How is output controlled? (Print, return, logging)
* [ ] Are side effects allowed? Or is everything pure by default?

## 7. Concurrency and Asynchronous Code

* [ ] Can code be executed asynchronously or in parallel?
* [ ] Are there language primitives for "tasks," "promises," etc.?
* [ ] Is this left to the host language/environment?

## 8. Numeric Precision and Limits

* [ ] Are there upper/lower bounds on rationals, intervals, decimals?
* [ ] Can overflow/underflow occur? How is it handled?
* [ ] How is numeric precision for real/irrational numbers specified, controlled, or displayed?

## 9. User-Defined Syntax and Macros

* [ ] Can users define custom operators, infix notation, or macros?
* [ ] Can users extend system syntax (e.g., add block types, infix operators)?

## 10. Comments and Documentation

* [ ] Are there conventions for doc-comments or inline documentation?
* [ ] How can documentation be associated with code, functions, modules?

## 11. Testing and Debugging

* [ ] How can code be tested interactively or in batch mode?
* [ ] Are there built-in `assert`, `test`, or debugging features?
* [ ] How is error reporting managed (location, format)?

## 12. Versioning and Compatibility

* [ ] How are language or standard library versions tracked?
* [ ] Can modules declare a required or expected version?

---

## Meta-Language and Grammar

* [ ] Is there a canonical grammar specification? (Pratt, EBNF, etc.)
* [ ] Is whitespace significant outside strings/comments?
* [ ] How are ambiguities or parsing conflicts resolved?
